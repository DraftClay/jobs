**And now we're looking for someone to join as a part-time technical content specialist.**

-----

### We'd Like Someone Who:
- Has a deep understanding of certain technical topics (must have prior technical experience in this field)
- Can perform quick research in related fields to supplement personal knowledge
- Understands what developers would like to know and can guide writers in that direction
- Communicates professionally and politely when suggesting improvements to writers
- Hits deadlines and proactively communicates with the Draft.dev team as necessary

### What You'll Do
You'll convert high-level article pitches into a structured plan for our freelance writers, who are software developers and other technical professionals.

Once an article is written, you'll review it for technical accuracy. You'll leave professional and clear comments in the article's Google Doc, pointing out any technical revisions the writer needs to address. Sometimes this will mean:
- Following along with a tutorial and making sure steps are clear and complete.
- Noticing when tools are obviously used or necessary but not mentioned.
- Making sure that any demo apps work.
- Reading documentation and learning how a new tool works. 

Rarely, you may be asked if you are able to complete a revision if for some reason the original writer is not able to.

### Expectations:
- Write content plans for ~12 articles per week
- Review 5+ technical articles per week (depending on your availability)
- Offer prompt, professional, relevant communication via email and comments in Google Docs

### Perks:
- 100% flexible hours, location, and asynchronous work
- Regular feedback from our team and clients
- Work directly with Draft.dev's technical lead
- Help shape the direction of a quickly growing small business

### Preference given to:
- Data Engineering / SQL / Streaming Data
- Data Science / AI / ML / DL / NLP / MLOps
- Team Leadership / Agile Methodologies (Scrum / Kanban)
- DevSecOps / Cyber Security / Kubernetes / Docker
- Site Reliability Engineering
- QA / Testing
